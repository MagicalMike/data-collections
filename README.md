The **Data Collections** project is a collection of apps, consisting of:

* **Client** - used for passing requests to the proxy app and collect resources from all found nodes
* **Proxy** - used for obtaining requests from the client and forwarding requests to each node discovered. The proxy also processes additional options sent by the client.
* **Node** - consists of a server that contains a certain payload and connections to other nodes.

The app uses [BlueSocket](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/BlueSocket) for its TCP/UDP transport capabilities.
